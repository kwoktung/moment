# Cloudflare Environment Types Rule

## Generated Files - Do Not Modify

**NEVER modify or edit the `cloudflare-env.d.ts` file.**

This file is auto-generated by Cloudflare tooling and contains TypeScript type definitions for Cloudflare Workers environment. Any manual changes will be overwritten when the file is regenerated.

### What to do instead:
- If you need to add custom types for Cloudflare bindings, create a separate `.d.ts` file in the project
- If you need to update types, modify the configuration that generates this file (e.g., `wrangler.toml`, `wrangler.jsonc`)
- Reference the existing types from `cloudflare-env.d.ts` but do not modify them directly

### When asked to make changes:
- Politely inform the user that `cloudflare-env.d.ts` is a generated file and should not be manually edited
- Suggest alternative approaches that don't involve modifying this file
